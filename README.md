<h2> Project Description. </h2>

For this project I decided I wanted to make a site based on facts and history on different food dishes/cuisines. Having several years of experience in the restaurant industry has given me a special appreciation for different foods from different cultures. Watching Anthony Bourdain's show was also an influence as it showed how the dishes from specific parts of the world tell a story about who the people are and why they ate what they ate.
